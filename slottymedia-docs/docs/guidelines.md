# Guidelines / Conventions
## General Formatting Guidelines

- Preserve Settings: Follow the existing project formatting rules.
- Automatic Formatting: Regularly use Rider's automatic formatting function (Ctrl+Alt+L).

## Code Layout
- Line Length: Maximum of 120 characters per line.
- Indented Blocks: Use tabs or 4 spaces for indentation (depending on project settings).
- Blank Lines: Use blank lines to separate logical code blocks.

## Indentation and Spacing
- Indent Blocks: Always use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- Braces: Opening braces on the same line as the statement, closing braces on a new line.
- Operator Spacing: Add spaces around operators like +, -, *, /, =, ==, etc.
- Commas and Semicolons: Add a space after commas and semicolons, not before.

## Naming Conventions

- Classes and Methods: Use PascalCase.
- Variables and Fields: Use camelCase.
- Constants: Use SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

## Comments
If not obvious, or the method is more than 5 lines, it should be commented.

- Single-line Comments: Use // for single-line comments
- Multi-line Comments: Use /* ... */ for multi-line comments.
- Documentation Comments: Use /// for documentation comments.

### Documentation Comments
We use the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/">xml documentation convention by microsoft</a>

In short: You can use the following tags structures in your documentation comment to specify properties of the following code:

- ```<summary>Your code summary</summary>```
- ```<param name="str">Describe parameter.</param>```: Usage may also be nested within summary
- ```<code>Use a codeblock within</code>```
- ```<example>Put a example here</example>```

There are plenty more tags. You can even reference other doc segments. 
If you need other tags, take a look <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/xmldoc/recommended-tags">here</a>

## Usings and Namespaces

- Sorting: Sort usings alphabetically and group by system namespace.
- Removing: Remove unused usings.
- Namespace: A file should contain a single namespace.

## Error Handling

- Exceptions: Always catch specific exceptions when possible.

## Unit Tests
Every method should be unit testable and have a unit test for it.

## Follow MVVM Pattern!

## Commit Messages

### How should my commit messages look like?

Our repo follows the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">Conventional Commits</a> guidelines.

Allowed commit types are specified as following:

- feat -> Introduces a new features
- fix -> Fixes a bug
- docs -> Updates on the docs
- chore -> Updates a grunt task; no-production code change
- style -> Formatting code style (missing semicolon, prettier execution, etc)
- refactor -> Refactoring existing code e.g. renaming a variable, reworking a function
- ci -> CI Tasks e.g. adding a hook
- test -> Adding new tests, refactoring tests, deleting old tests
- revert -> Revert old commits
- perf -> Performance related refactoring, without functional changes

## Branch Naming

Your branche names should follow this style:

[commit-type]/[topic-of-branch-seperated-by-hyphen]

F.e. if you want to introduce a new cool type of button your branch should have the name:

feat/cool-new-button
